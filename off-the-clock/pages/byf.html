<p>My twt is very RT-heavy, mostly with fanarts from series I'm really invested in.</p>
<p>I will always RT Tsukki and Sebastian Michaelis tho LOL</p>
<p>Most posted content is PG-16 tbh, but my likes <i>can</i> be NSFW sometimes so tread carefully <i
        class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i></p>
<p>I keep this twt mainly for games/shows/series that I like, most twt memes/posts are usually posted on my personal twt
    (i like to filter my content). The only exception is when news needs to be spread.</p>
<p>Very open to DMs if you ever need to msg me for literally anything! I'm a down bad night owl <i
        class="far fa-moon"></i> so i'm pretty much available 24/7 dsfjgkhfg</p>
<p><b>typing style:</b> i use emojis almost everywhere! &#10024; i LOL/LMAO a looooooot, and i don't censor swears too
    much; if it bothers you, i don't think following would be a good idea ^^</p>
<h1>Don't follow if or Will sb/hb if....</h1>
<p>You have views that are considered problematic (and concerning), especially to sensitive topics such as race,
    sexuality and politics</p>
<p>Under 16 (but if you ever need to talk I can lend an ear!)</p>
<p>Also, no hard feelings if you sb/hb me! My interests/content may not be for everyone, and sometimes I can be a lil
    too much with my fangirling LMAOO</p>
